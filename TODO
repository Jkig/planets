Things i want to get done:


then i want to make a simple react page where you can select the different options, with given bounds to stay in habitable regions
then use local storage to create equivilant to basic Scene json, then on submit send user to view the system

lastly i need to make the earth look good, use shader to transition from the day to night, and add normal map and spectral map, maybe add the clouds in too


and other moons.


(don't need it to all be react to do a basic one)

standardize and fix up the perspective camera where i want it to be (doesn't make far away things small enought)

can have ppl calibrate their screne by lining up moon and sun, and having a slider control perspective, will do this later...

resize inputs so there is an inner half and outer half, can cover habitable zones, and then crazy stuff, more intuative


More urgent:
I need to allow camera/whole scene to resize if they make super crazy big systemes, for later
there is a bug for other sized stars, probably unit conversion
add a back button
make sun look good keep texture for other colors, not sure yet how to do this
pass in luminosity to scale brightness (maybe just number relative to sun... index it to 1)
read the local object to initialize everything for this

probs a tiny bit of ambient light after shader for night stuff
(night lights emissive??)

maybe seperate earth and jupiter into different files




TODOTODO::

swaped view.html to view in setup.jsx link and in firebase.json, this may change things
