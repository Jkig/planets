Things i want to get done:

In basicScene.json
I need to add the folowing properties:
tilt
sun color

then i want to make a simple react page where you can select the different options, with given bounds to stay in habitable regions
then use local storage to create equivilant to basic Scene json, then on submit send user to view the system

lastly i need to make the earth look good, use shader to transition from the day to night, and add normal map and spectral map, maybe add the clouds in too


and other moons.


(don't need it to all be react to do a basic one)
