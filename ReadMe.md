Hello!


This fun little project started becuase I keps seeing art in space that depicted scenes that were very unrealistic, just from my gut feeling, "that moon can't be that close to that planet, it would get torn apart" and stuff like that. 
The goal is that artists could get a reference to use when creating scenes, generally, the most important planets are ones that are habitable.

While there are tons and tons of features to add, i have to find ways to make it still easy to use, which means less features and cutting down uptions until i'm ready, open to suggestions though.

I want to add a lot of possible systems, most exciting is binary or trinary star systems.

Also excited to work on more gas giants, with different compositions and thus colors, and even creating (a few) using fluid simulations
